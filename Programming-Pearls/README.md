# Programming Pearls

In this section we would like to collect and discuss examples that show
idomatic (Forth) programming style.

- [Day of the week](day-of-the-week): work with string sequences, map from number to string
- [Print Hex](print-hex): print hex numbers with variable number of digits, w/o <# # #> 
- [Conditional Compilation](condicompi): exelectively process part of the program text depending on conditions and variants, ICE concept
- [Population Count](Population%20Count): counting the number of set bits in a byte or word
