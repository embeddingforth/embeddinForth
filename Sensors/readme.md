# Sensors

The idea is to give examples for a variety of avialable sensors.
To measure time, temperature, pressure, magnetism, distance, light level, etc.


|  Sensor | Purpose |  Short description |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| HC-SR04 | Measure distance | Measures distance using Ultrasonic sound |
| LM75(A) | Temperature | Measures temperature with half degree resolution |
| TMP75 | Temperature | Measures temperature with  0.0625°C. resolution |
| APDS9300 | (IR)Light | Infrared and visual light sensor |
| TCND5000 | Reflection sensor | Detection of nearby subjects |
| PIR | Motion detector | Passive infrared motion detector |
| Touch | Touch sensors | Mechanical switch or capacitive touch switch & slider |
