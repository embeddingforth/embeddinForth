# Sensors

The idea is to give examples for a variety of avialable sensors.  
To measure time, temperature, pressure, magnetism, distance, light level, etc.  


|  Sensor | Purpose |  Short description |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| [HC-SR04](Measuring-distance) | Measure distance | Measures distance using Ultrasonic sound |
| [LM75(A)](https://github.com/project-forth-works/project-forth-works/blob/main/Communication-Protocols/I2C/Device-drivers/LM75.f) | Temperature | Measures temperature with .5° Celcius resolution |
| [TMP75](https://github.com/project-forth-works/project-forth-works/blob/main/Communication-Protocols/I2C/Device-drivers/TMP75.f) | Temperature | Measures temperature with  0.0625° Celcius resolution |
| [APDS9300](https://github.com/project-forth-works/project-forth-works/blob/main/Communication-Protocols/I2C/Device-drivers/APDS9300.f) | (IR)Light | Infrared and visual light sensor |
| [PIR](https://home.hccnet.nl/willem.ouwerkerk/egel-for-msp430/egel%20for%20launchpad.html#e018) | Motion detector | Passive infrared motion detector |
| [Touch](https://home.hccnet.nl/willem.ouwerkerk/egel-for-msp430/egel%20for%20launchpad.html#e019) | Touch sensors | [Mechanical switch](https://home.hccnet.nl/willem.ouwerkerk/egel-for-msp430/egel%20for%20launchpad.html#e018) or capacitive touch switch & slider |
| [BME280](https://github.com/project-forth-works/project-forth-works/blob/main/Communication-Protocols/SPI/GD32VF/mecrisp-quintus/BME280/BMP280.fs) | Pressure, temperature & humidity |  Measure pressure, temperature and humidity |
| [TCND5000](Reflection-sensors) | Reflection sensor | Detection of nearby subjects | 

More info look at each individual subject.
