# String handling

## The idea

When you need to add text strings to each other to construct new character strings.  
We need a word set to do just that. Original idea [Albert van der Horst](https://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/index.html). 
Examples are:  

- Manipulate files
- Start programs
- Add, delete and use folders/directories
- Etc.

## Construction of strings

Strings in Forth are of the type address & length as is shown in the picture:



- String word sets
  - [Primitive string word set](Primitive-string-word-set.f) \(Simple string word set e.g. for file and OS interfacing)
  - Etc.
