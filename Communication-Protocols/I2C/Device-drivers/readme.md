# I2C device drivers

## The idea for I2C device drivers
There are lots of chips available using the I2C-protocol. All of them need a specific device driver. To name some: sensors, memory, clocks, I/O, etc. Here you can add any driver you like to share preferably written in **Generic Forth**. But as we embrace the differences, you may also ass then in a new folder for your own dialect !
